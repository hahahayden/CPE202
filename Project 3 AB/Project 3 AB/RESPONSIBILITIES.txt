Aaron Teh: 
I did the preord part. It wasn't too bad because we did the preord in the BST lab and all I had to do 
was check if the right and left children were none or existent. 
I also tested all the files and made sure that our code worked to encode and decode.


Hayden Tam: 
I did the decoding part and the helper function goDown. The trouble I had was going through every part of the tree
but I realized that we are reading the encoded file so I just reset the child to the root each time I hit a leaf node.
